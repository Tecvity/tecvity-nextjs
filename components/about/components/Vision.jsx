            A just cause for a company refers to the fundamental purpose or
            mission that drives the organization, beyond just making profits. It
            represents a higher sense of meaning or social responsibility,
            guiding the company's actions, decisions, and strategies. A just
            cause is often aligned with values, ethics, and a vision of creating
            positive impact in the world.
