## Steps for Adding a New Blog Post

You need to modify the list `blogPosts` in `data/blogs.js`, add the final object to list `blogPosts` to get your Blog posted.

### 1. Add an id for the Blog Post
The `id` (required) is the unique identifier for a blog post. Adding duplicates can lead to unexpected data in other blog posts. You need to assign an `id` that is one value greater than the previous blog post to maintain order. If the previous Blog id is `1` use `2`, Example:
```javascript 
id: 2,
```

### 2. Add a High-Quality Blog Image
The `image` (required) is displayed at the top of the blog post. Upload an image (dimensions: 1080x600) to the directory `public/assets/img/blog`. Ensure the image is named `blog_post_<id>_<serial number>.jpg`, where `<id>` needs to be replaced by blog post `id` and `<serial number>` needs to be replaced by serial numbers of your choice. Add the image path as shown:
```javscript 
image: '/assets/img/blog/blog_post_2_1.jpg', 
```

### 3. Add a Small Blog Image
The `smallImageUrl` (required) is displayed in the preview card of the blog post. Upload an image (dimensions: **180x140**) to the directory `public/assets/img/blog`. Ensure the image is named `blog_post_mini_<id>.jpg`, where `<id>` needs to be replaced by blog post `id`. Add the image path as shown:
```javascript 
smallImageUrl: '/assets/img/blog/blog_post_mini_2.jpg', 
```

### 4. Add the Post Date
The `date` (required) is used to determine the most recent posts and to display the date when the blog was published. Use the format `Month DD, YYYY`, as shown below:
```javascript 
date: 'November 1, 2024', 
```

### 5. Assign a Category
The `category` (required) is used to filter blogs based on the category they belong to. Select an existing category from the `categories` list in `data/categories-tags.js`. If you want to add a new category, include it in the `categories` list in `data/categories-tags.js` before using it, as shown below:
```javascript
 category: 'category',
```

### 6. Add a Title
The `title` (required) is used to name a blog post and is also included in the route of that specific blog. Use a descriptive title and avoid symbols or random characters, as the title will be used for routing, as shown below:
```javascript
 title: 'Your New Blog Post',
```

### 7. Add Tags
The `tags` (required) are used to define the topics of the blog post. Include at least one tag in an array. Choose tags from the tags `list` in `data/categories-tags.js` or add your own tags to the tags `list` in `data/categories-tags.js` before using them, as shown below:
```javascript
tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2', 'Tag3'],
 ```

### 8. Add an Icon
The `icon` (required) is used as a visual only. Use the standard icon path given below, you don't need a new one:
```javascript
icon: '/assets/img/icon/arrow-left-top.svg',
 ```

### 9. Add the Author's Name
The `author` (required) is used to display the name of person who wrote the blog post. Just add the author name, as shown below:
```javascript
author: 'Author 1', 
```

### 10. Add the Author's Quote
The `authorQuote` (required) is used to display a bold quote or slogan related to the platform or blog. Example:
```javascript
authorQuote: 'Technology + Creativity = Tecvity!', 
```

### 11. Add the Author's Image
The `authorImage` (required) is the display image of the author. Upload an image to `public/assets/img/team` or use your own `URL`. Alternatively, if no image is available, you can use the placeholder image `team.png`, which is already saved in `public/assets/img/team` for you, as shown below:
```javascript
 authorImage: '/assets/img/team/team.png', 
 ```

### 12. Add the Author's Profile
The `authorProfile` (optional) is the profile of author if he is also one of the founders, include your profile path. Otherwise, set it to null. Example:
```javascript
 authorProfile: '/founders/Najam-Ul-Saqib',  or  authorProfile: null, 
```

### 13. Add Blog Content
The outermost `content` (required) is the actual blog post. Within the content, the `introduction` (required) serves as the introduction to the blog post, and the `sections` (required) describes different sections of the post. The `sections` can also be an empty array `[]` if no sections are added. If you want to add different sections, see [Add Blog Sections](#14-add-blog-sections). Example:
```javascript
 content: { 
    introduction: 'We believe that the key to our success is our team...', 
    sections: [] 
  } 
  ```

### 14. Add Blog Sections
The `sections` (required) are used to add different sections in the blog post. Each section must include a `heading` (required) and either `list`, `content`, or `services` (one is required at a time). The `list`/`services` is used to add items in the form of list, while `content` is used to display simple text without any styling. A sample is shown below:
```javascript
content: {
    introduction: "...",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Key Highlights",
        list: [
          { title: "Highlight 1", description: "Highlight description" },
          { title: "Highlight 2", description: "Highlight description" }
        ]
      },
      {
        heading: "Our Approach",
        content: "We focus on understanding client needs and delivering tailor-made solutions."
      },
      {
        heading: "Services Overview",
        services: [
          { title: "Service 1", description: "service description" },
          { title: "Service 2", description: "service description" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  } 
  ```

Ensure each image is named as `portfolio<id>_<serial number>.jpg`, where `<id>` is replaced with the portfolio `id` and `<serial number>` is replaced with serial numbers of your choice.  

Add these image file paths to the `itemsImages` array.
```javascript
