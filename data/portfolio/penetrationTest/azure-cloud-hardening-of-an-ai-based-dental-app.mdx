## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Dental App is a platform designed to streamline administrative tasks and enhance patient engagement for dental practices. A comprehensive security assessment was conducted to ensure the safety of sensitive patient and operational data.

## Challenge

Our main was to strengthen the security of the appâ€™s Azure cloud environment. This included identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities, implementing role-based access control (RBAC), encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit, and ensuring compliance with healthcare industry standards. The app required a secure, scalable infrastructure to support its AI-driven operations and data management needs.

## Final Result

Tecvity implemented advanced Azure security hardening measures, including data encryption, network hardening, and robust access controls. The solution ensured a secure and compliant cloud environment, enabling the app to deliver innovative AI solutions for dental practices confidently.
