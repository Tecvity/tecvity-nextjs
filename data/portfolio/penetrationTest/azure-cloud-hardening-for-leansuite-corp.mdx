## Project Overview

LeanSuite is a cloud-based lean manufacturing application designed to help manufacturing businesses drive efficiency and productivity on the factory floor. It offers solutions such as a suggestion platform with a simple, intuitive interface that boosts employee engagement and collaboration, ultimately improving business operations.

## Challenge

The primary objective of the project was to enhance the security posture of LeanSuite's Azure cloud environment. This involved implementing private endpoints to restrict access, hardening network configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities, encrypting data both at rest and in transit to ensure its confidentiality and integrity, and configuring robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions for proactive threat monitoring and compliance.

## Final Result

Through a comprehensive approach, the Tecvity team successfully implemented the necessary security measures, enabling LeanSuite to achieve SOC 2 certification. This accomplishment not only demonstrates LeanSuite's commitment to maintaining high security standards but also proves the professionalism and expertise of Tecvity in achieving their clients' objectives, ensuring secure and compliant cloud operations.
