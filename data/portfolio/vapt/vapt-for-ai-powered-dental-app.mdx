## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Dental App is a platform designed to streamline administrative tasks and enhance patient engagement for dental practices. A comprehensive security assessment was conducted to ensure the safety of sensitive patient and operational data.

## Challenge

The primary challenge was testing the platform's AI-driven functionalities and its integration with dental practice management systems (PMS). The assessment required an in-depth understanding of the platform's architecture and its unique healthcare-related features.

## Final Result

The security assessment uncovered several medium and low-severity vulnerabilities, which were promptly reported to the development team. These vulnerabilities were addressed effectively, significantly enhancing the platform's security posture and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
