## Project Overview

The Student Loan Refinancing Platform is designed to help users compare loan options quickly and securely. This penetration test focused on identifying vulnerabilities in both the admin and user web applications, ensuring the platformâ€™s security against potential threats.

## Challenge

The primary challenge was conducting a comprehensive Gray Box Penetration Test, where the testing team had limited access to the internal workings of the platform. The test involved assessing the overall security posture using the ASVS checklist provided by OWASP, ensuring that the platform adhered to industry-standard security practices across all layers.

## Final Result

The penetration test uncovered several high and medium-severity vulnerabilities, including issues related to improper error handling, misconfigurations, and exposed API keys. These vulnerabilities were reported to the development team to take immediate action to address and patch the identified security flaws.
