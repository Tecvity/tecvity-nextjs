## Project Overview

The Aviation Maintenance Platform is a solution for streamlining aircraft maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO). Designed for aviation professionals, it offers tools for maintenance tracking, parts management, collaboration, and data analytics. Our Gray Box Penetration Test focused on identifying vulnerabilities within their network and application to ensure a secure operational environment.

## Challenge

The primary objective of the test was to uncover security issues that could compromise the platform's functionality and data integrity. This included assessing the network for configuration flaws and evaluating the application for vulnerabilities such as improper access control and insecure data handling.

## Final Result

The initial penetration test identified several critical and high-severity security issues in their network and application, including misconfigurations, improper access control, and data exposure risks. A follow-up penetration test conducted in the same month verified the successful implementation of patches and enhancements to address the reported vulnerabilities. This demonstrates the professionalism and instant solution-providing capabilities of the Tecvity team, ensuring the platform's security and reliability for its users.
