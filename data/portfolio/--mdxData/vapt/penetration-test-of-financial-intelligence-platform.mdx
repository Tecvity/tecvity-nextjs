## Project Overview

A cloud-based Verified Financial Intelligence (VFI) platform designed to assist forensic accountants in transforming financial documents into courtroom-ready evidence. Leveraging advanced AI, the platform enables rapid tracing of fund flows, enhancing the speed and accuracy of financial analyses.

## Challenge

The objective of this penetration test was to assess the security posture of the platform's web application and underlying infrastructure. The focus was on identifying vulnerabilities related to business logic, particularly concerning the processing and analysis of financial data, as well as any misconfigurations that could compromise data integrity or confidentiality.

## Final Result

The penetration test uncovered several high and medium-severity vulnerabilities, including business logic flaws that could potentially allow unauthorized manipulation of data. These findings were promptly reported to the platform's security team, who acknowledged the issues and initiated remediation efforts to enhance the platform's security and maintain compliance with industry standards.
