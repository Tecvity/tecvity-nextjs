## Project Overview

The target was a network packet capture platform specializing in high-performance, lossless packet capture solutions ranging from 10Gbps to 100Gbps. The platform offers cost-effective appliances designed to integrate seamlessly into existing network infrastructures, providing precise and reliable packet capture capabilities.

## Challenge

The engagement involved conducting a black box penetration test with only an IP address provided. The primary objective was to enumerate the target's network services and configurations to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by external attackers.

## Final Result

The penetration test did not uncover any critical issues within the network. However, several areas were identified where security configurations could be enhanced to further strengthen the platform's defenses. These recommendations were communicated to the platform's security team, who acknowledged the insights and planned for proactive improvements to maintain a robust security posture.
