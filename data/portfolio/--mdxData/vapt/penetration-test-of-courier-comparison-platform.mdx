## Project Overview

The Courier Comparison Platform is an online service that allows users to compare courier and freight quotes, providing affordable and efficient delivery solutions. This white box penetration test focused on their web application, APIs, and admin control panel, aiming to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

## Challenge

The primary focus of the penetration test was to discover any potential security issues in the platform, ensuring the protection of user data and the integrity of the application. This included assessing the APIs for improper authentication, the admin control panel for privilege escalation risks, and the web application for potential vulnerabilities in its codebase.

## Final Result

The penetration test identified several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities related to business logic, file upload validation, cloud infrastructure, improper sanitization, and access control. These issues were promptly reported and addressed to improve the platformâ€™s security posture.
