## Project Overview

Mach7t is a leading healthcare company in the United States that develops multiple products specializing in Vendor Neutral Archives. They approached Tecvity to get their product suite tested for security vulnerabilities.

## Challenge

For testing the security of a product, you should know all the ins and outs of it to be able to properly test it. The challenge was that Mach7t's products were not like just another application; they had a lot of healthcare-specific features and functionalities that are not known to normal users.

## Final Result

Our team worked with Mach7t to understand their suite properly and then performed comprehensive security testing, resulting in multiple critical and high-severity issues detected and reported. Mach7t works with Tecvity for their continuous security engagements on a regular basis, and we're proud to have them as our permanent client.
