## Project Overview

This Family Office Collaboration Platform is a centralized workspace designed to provide families and their advisors with a secure environment for collaboration, document management, and task tracking. It offers features like group workspaces, a family context hub, and a secure document vault, focusing on streamlining workflows and ensuring data security.

## Challenge

The objective of this penetration test was to evaluate the security of the platform’s web application and APIs. One of the challenges was to understand and test the GraphQL API thoroughly, ensuring no vulnerabilities existed in its design or implementation. Additionally, the test aimed to identify vulnerabilities that could compromise sensitive family data or disrupt the platform’s functionality, with a focus on business logic, API security, and configuration settings.

## Final Result

The penetration test identified several medium and low-severity vulnerabilities related to API security, business logic flaws, and misconfigurations. These issues were promptly reported to the platform's security team, who addressed them to enhance the overall security and reliability of the platform.
