## Project Overview

Rembrandt is a leading manufacturer of corporate jewelry, catering to global markets with its distinctive and comprehensive awards programs. As a Canadian-owned and operated company, Rembrandt stands as one of the country's premier suppliers of service and recognition awards.

## Challenge

The objective of this penetration test was to evaluate the security of the platformâ€™s web application and network infrastructure. One of the challenges was to understand and test the underlying system thoroughly in a short span of time.

## Final Result

The penetration test identified several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities related to app security, business logic flaws, and misconfigurations. These issues were promptly reported to the platform's development team and appropriate remediations were suggested.
