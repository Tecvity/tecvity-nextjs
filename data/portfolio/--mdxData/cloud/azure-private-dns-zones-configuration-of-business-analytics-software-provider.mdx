## Project Overview

A software provider specializing in next-generation business analytics tools aimed at streamlining workflows for M&A professionals, finance departments, and organizations. Their solutions include tools for finance management, FP&A capabilities, M&A processes, and cloud data analytics, helping businesses improve efficiency and decision-making.

## Challenge

The primary objective was to configure and secure private DNS zones in Azure. The software provider had previously spent significant resources on DNS zone configuration, relying on IP addresses for authentication. This approach led to operational complexities and heightened security risks. The goal was to simplify authentication processes and enhance security using Azure’s advanced features.

## Final Result

In just 10 minutes, Tecvity addressed the DNS configuration challenges by implementing private DNS zones and enabling Entra ID authentication using DNS names. This solution eliminated the reliance on IP-based authentication, streamlined operations, and strengthened security. The rapid resolution showcased Tecvity’s expertise and professionalism in delivering tailored cloud security solutions.
