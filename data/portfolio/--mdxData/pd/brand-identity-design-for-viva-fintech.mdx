## Brand identity design for Viva Fintech

Viva is an AI-powered fintech company redefining the way people interact with financial services. With a focus on innovation and simplicity, Viva seamlessly combines cutting-edge technology with user-centric design, aiming to empower individuals and businesses to navigate their financial journeys effortlessly.

### Challenge

Crafting a brand identity for Viva demanded a delicate balance between modernity, sophistication, and approachability. The goal was to create a visual system that conveyed the company’s innovative edge while maintaining a sense of trust and simplicity. Additionally, the identity needed to stand out in a crowded fintech market while remaining versatile across various platforms and mediums.

### Final Result

We developed a bold and memorable brand identity system centered around a clean wordmark logo. The logo’s geometric design reflects precision and clarity, embodying Viva’s commitment to simplicity and innovation. A dynamic gradient of orange, contrasted with ample white space, injects energy and modernity into the visual identity, making it both striking and versatile. The result is a brand system that captures the essence of Viva: modern, simple, and distinctly different.
